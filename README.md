# Project Submission
Our project submission includes five primary files – two data files, two code files, and a presentation:
1.  **covid_search_results_summary.xls** : Excel file containing over 240 search engine results for various COVID-related queries. These data are used to train and test the analytical models.
2.  **url_accuracy.xls** : Excel file containing over 3,400 judgments of website factual accuracy, based on assessments from organizations like MediaBiasFactCheck, NewsGuard, HON, and others. These data are used by the models.
3.  **CS410_COVID_Notebook_A.ipynb** : Python notebook that scrapes results from three search engines, builds a discriminative model, and assesses its accuracy.  This program requires the two data files above. Of the five project objectives, Notebook A achieves 1 through 4. However, it does not provide an interactive way for a user to enter his or her own choice of websites to analyze.
4.  **CS410_COVID_Notebook_B.ipynb** : Python notebook that provides an interactive assessment of user input using a generative model. This program also requires the two data files above. Of the five project objectives, Notebook B achieves 2 through 4 and provides a way for users to enter a website for analysis. Finally, Notebook B uses a different modeling technique, so the reviewer can see the performance of different methods.
5.  **CS410_COVID_Team_Presentation.pptx** : PowerPoint presentation containing (a) overview of the notebooks and what they do, (b) how the notebooks are implemented, (c) how to install and run each notebook, and (d) summary contributions of each team member. 

There is also a "voiced PPT presentation" that adds voice-over narration to the above PowerPoint. All content other than the voice-over is identical, so the reviewer may view either the narrated or un-narrated version. The narrated version is too big for GitHub as a single file, so it has been divided into two parts: 

6.  **CS410_COVID_Narrated_Presentation_1_of_2.pptx** - First part of the narrated overview and usage presentation. 
7.  **CS410_COVID_Narrated_Presentation_2_of_2.pptx** - Second part of the narrated overview and usage presentation.

### Course Project Instructions
Before completing these steps, please make sure that you have signed up for Microsoft CMT according to the directions listed in the Google doc. Every team member must create a CMT account.

The following steps need to be completed ONCE by the Team Leader ONLY
1.	Fork the Course Project github repo by clicking on the “Fork” button on Github. Your fork is the main place to submit all the course project submission, i.e. proposals, progress reports, code, final software documentation, demo presentations, etc.
<b>Naming:</b> The project will be manually graded, so there are no specific names required as long as they are easily recognizable (or better yet, described in the Readme file).
<b>Format:</b> The proposal, progress report, and final documentation can be a word/pdf document.
<b>Grading:</b> The proposal, progress report, and final documentation will be peer-graded by all of you (with guidance from the instructors). We will later provide more details on the peer-grading process and reviewer functionality on CMT. 
2. Log into Microsoft CMT and click on “All Conferences”. Search for the conference named “CS410Expo2022” and click on the conference. Make sure to select the 2022 iteration!
3. Click “+ Create New Submission”.
4. Enter your Project Topic in the “Title” field. In the “Abstract” field, enter the URL of your fork created in step 1. It is critical that you enter the GitHub URL in the Abstract field for peer grading!
5.  Add the emails of all the team members under authors. It is critical that you enter all of your teammates’ emails for peer reviews and grading!
6. Select the subject area that fits the theme of your project (and that you selected as the track in the sign-up sheet). 
7. Finally, click on “Submit”.  You can skip the “Conflicts of Interest” and click “Done”. 
All these steps need to be done ONLY ONCE for the course project. Just keep adding the relevant files to your Github fork for all the required submissions.
