# CourseProject

Before completing these steps, please make sure that you have signed up for Microsoft CMT according to the directions listed in the Google doc. Every team member must create a CMT account.

The following steps need to be completed ONCE by the Team Leader ONLY
1.	Fork the Course Project github repo by clicking on the “Fork” button on Github. Your fork is the main place to submit all the course project submission, i.e. proposals, progress reports, code, final software documentation, demo presentations, etc.
<b>Naming:</b> The project will be manually graded, so there are no specific names required as long as they are easily recognizable (or better yet, described in the Readme file).
<b>Format:</b> The proposal, progress report, and final documentation can be a word/pdf document.
<b>Grading:</b> The proposal, progress report, and final documentation will be peer-graded by all of you (with guidance from the instructors). We will later provide more details on the peer-grading process and reviewer functionality on CMT. 

2. Log into Microsoft CMT and click on “All Conferences”. Search for the conference named “CS410Expo2022” and click on the conference. Make sure to select the 2022 iteration!
3. Click “+ Create New Submission”.
4. Enter your Project Topic in the “Title” field. In the “Abstract” field, enter the URL of your fork created in step 1. It is critical that you enter the GitHub URL in the Abstract field for peer grading!
5.  Add the emails of all the team members under authors. It is critical that you enter all of your teammates’ emails for peer reviews and grading!
6. Select the subject area that fits the theme of your project (and that you selected as the track in the sign-up sheet). 
7. Finally, click on “Submit”.  You can skip the “Conflicts of Interest” and click “Done”. 
All these steps need to be done ONLY ONCE for the course project. Just keep adding the relevant files to your Github fork for all the required submissions.
